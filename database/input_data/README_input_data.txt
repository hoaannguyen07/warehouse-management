Run the rows_data.sql, columns_data.sql, levels_data.sql, types_data.sql, and permissions_data.sql in any order because
they do not interfere with each other (don't depend on each other).

<CAUTION:> Personnel script and personnel_permissions script was made up for testing. you could put in your own data.
<CAUTION:> However, the location script uses credentials from the personnel script, so if you want to just run the location
<CAUTION:> script without doing anything extra, run the personnel and personnel_permissions script before running the location script.
<CAUTION:> REMEMBER, run the above scripts before you run the location script
<CAUTION:> MAKE SURE YOUR locations_data.sql SCRIPT IS THE LAST SCRIPT YOU RUN
